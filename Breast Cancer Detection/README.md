# Overview
Breast cancer detection remains one of the most impactful applications of machine learning in healthcare. In this challenge, your task is to build a binary image classification model that can accurately distinguish between malignant (M) and normal (N) breast tissue images.


# Description
your mission is to develop a model that predicts whether a given breast tissue image shows signs of malignancy. You’ll need to balance accuracy with robustness since the dataset is small, overfitting and poor generalization are key challenges to overcome.

# Evaluation
The evaluation will be using accuracy score metric
